description: Context with deferred tool loading for reduced initial overhead
prompt: |
  You are running with deferred tool loading enabled.
  Only core tools are available initially to reduce overhead and improve startup time.
  Use `search_tools` to discover additional tools when you need them.

  This context is useful for environments where minimizing the initial tool count is important,
  such as when working with LLM providers that have token limits on tool definitions.
