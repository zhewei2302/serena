# the language backend to use for code understanding and manipulation.
# Possible values are:
#  * LSP: Use the language server protocol (LSP), spawning freely available language servers
#      via the SolidLSP library that is part of Serena.
#  * JetBrains: Use the Serena plugin in your JetBrains IDE.
#      (requires the plugin to be installed and the project being worked on to be open
#      in your IDE).
language_backend: LSP

# whether to open a graphical window with Serena's logs.
# This is mainly supported on Windows and (partly) on Linux; not available on macOS.
# If you prefer a browser-based tool, use the `web_dashboard` option instead.
# Further information: https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/060_dashboard.html
#
# Being able to inspect logs is useful both for troubleshooting and for monitoring the tool calls,
# especially when using the agno playground, since the tool calls are not always shown,
# and the input params are never shown in the agno UI.
# When used as MCP server for Claude Desktop, the logs are primarily for troubleshooting.
# Note: unfortunately, the various entities starting the Serena server or agent do so in
# mysterious ways, often starting multiple instances of the process without shutting down
# previous instances. This can lead to multiple log windows being opened, and only the last
# window being updated. Since we can't control how agno or Claude Desktop start Serena,
# we have to live with this limitation for now.
gui_log_window: False

# whether to open the Serena web dashboard (which will be accessible through your web browser) that
# provides access to Serena's configuration and state as well as the current session logs.
# The web dashboard is supported on all platforms.
# We strongly recommend to always enable this option, since the dashboard provides important information
# about the current state of Serena, including the configuration, the logs and tool usage statistics.
# If you don't want the browser window to pop up automatically, set the `web_dashboard_open_on_launch` to False
# (either here or through the corresponding flag in the `start-mcp-server` CLI command).
# You can then open the dashboard by asking your agent to do so (e.g., by saying "open the dashboard"), Serena provides
# a tool for this.
# Further information: https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/060_dashboard.html
web_dashboard: True

web_dashboard_listen_address: 127.0.0.1

# whether to open a browser window with the web dashboard when Serena starts (provided that web_dashboard
# is enabled). See also the web_dashboard option.
# If set to false, you can still open the dashboard manually by
# a) telling the LLM to "open the dashboard" (provided that the open_dashboard tool is enabled) or by
# b) manually navigating to http://localhost:24282/dashboard/ in your web browser (actual port
#    may be higher if you have multiple instances running; try ports 24283, 24284, etc.)
# See also: https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/060_dashboard.html

# whether to trace the communication between Serena and the language servers.
# This is useful for debugging language server issues.
trace_lsp_communication: False

# advanced configuration option allowing to configure language server-specific options.
# Maps the language key to the options.
# Have a look at the docstring of the constructors of the LS implementations within solidlsp (e.g., for C# or PHP) to see which options are available.
# No documentation on options means no options are available.

# the name of the token count estimator to use for tool usage statistics.
# See the `RegisteredTokenCountEstimator` enum for available options.
#
# By default, a very naive character count estimator is used, which simply counts the number of characters.
# You can configure this to TIKTOKEN_GPT4 to use a local tiktoken-based estimator for GPT-4 (will download tiktoken
# data files on first run), or ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_SONNET_4 which will use the (free of cost) Anthropic API to
# estimate the token count using the Claude Sonnet 4 tokenizer.
