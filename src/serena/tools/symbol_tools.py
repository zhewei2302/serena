        Retrieves information on all symbols/code entities (classes, methods, etc.) based on the given name path pattern.
        The returned symbol information can be used for edits or further queries.
        Specify `depth > 0` to also retrieve children/descendants (e.g., methods of a class).

        A name path is a path in the symbol tree *within a source file*.
        For example, the method `my_method` defined in class `MyClass` would have the name path `MyClass/my_method`.
        If a symbol is overloaded (e.g., in Java), a 0-based index is appended (e.g. "MyClass/my_method[0]") to
        uniquely identify it.

        To search for a symbol, you provide a name path pattern that is used to match against name paths.
        It can be
         * a simple name (e.g. "method"), which will match any symbol with that name
         * a relative path like "class/method", which will match any symbol with that name path suffix
         * an absolute name path "/class/method" (absolute name path), which requires an exact match of the full name path within the source file.
        Append an index `[i]` to match a specific overload only, e.g. "MyClass/my_method[1]".

        :param depth: depth up to which descendants shall be retrieved (e.g. use 1 to also retrieve immediate children;
            for the case where the symbol is a class, this will return its methods). Default 0.
        :param relative_path: Optional. Restrict search to this file or directory. If None, searches entire codebase.
            If a directory is passed, the search will be restricted to the files in that directory.
            If a file is passed, the search will be restricted to that file.
            If you have some knowledge about the codebase, you should use this parameter, as it will significantly
            speed up the search as well as reduce the number of results.
        :param include_body: whether to include the symbol's source code. Use judiciously.
        :param include_info: whether to include additional info (hover-like, typically including docstring and signature),
            about the symbol (ignored if include_body is True). Info is never included for child symbols.
            Note: Depending on the language, this can be slow (e.g., C/C++).
        :param include_kinds: List of LSP symbol kind integers to include.
            If not provided, all kinds are included.
        :param exclude_kinds: Optional. List of LSP symbol kind integers to exclude. Takes precedence over `include_kinds`.
            If not provided, no kinds are excluded.
        :param substring_matching: If True, use substring matching for the last element of the pattern, such that
            "Foo/get" would match "Foo/getValue" and "Foo/getData".
